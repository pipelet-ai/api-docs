# Virtual Influencer Generation API

Virtual Influencer is generated by a series of steps

1. Generate Speech (Text to Speech)
2. Generate Video Preview (Image to Video)
3. Upscale Video
4. Interpolate Video to High FPS

Each step can use the output from the previous step as input.
Each step can also allow uploading the data directly, bypassing the previous steps.

## Generate Speech
